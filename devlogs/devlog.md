Sprint 2 Complete: Character Switching System
Today I completed Sprint 2 of Shadow Swap development! The core character switching mechanism is now fully functional.
What's New:

Character Switching: Press F to seamlessly switch between the main character and shadow
Visual Feedback: Clear indicators show which character is active
Enhanced UI: Updated character indicators with better styling
Particle Effects: Added magical particle effects during character switching

Technical Improvements:

Implemented CharacterManager class following SOLID principles
Added proper activation/deactivation states for characters
Camera now smoothly follows the active character
Added visual glow effects for the shadow character

Created Github Workflows to automate builds and write devlogs

What's Next:
Sprint 3 will focus on platform collision systems and more complex level geometry. Looking forward to adding shadow-specific movement zones!
Screenshots:
The switching effect looks amazing with the purple particle burst connecting both characters. The camera transition is smooth and the visual feedback makes it clear which character you're controlling.
