Shadow Swap is a unique 2D platformer where you control both a character and their shadow to solve puzzles and navigate challenging environments. Switch between the two entities to overcome obstacles that neither could face alone!

Game Concept
Dual Character Control: Play as both a physical character and their shadow

Dynamic Environments: Light sources affect where your shadow can move

Puzzle Platforming: Solve environmental puzzles by coordinating both characters

Unique Mechanics: Shadow can walk on walls and ceilings where shadows are cast

Core Features
✔️ Switch between character and shadow with a button press
✔️ Shadow-only movement zones based on lighting
✔️ Interactive light sources that dynamically change shadow paths
✔️ Coordination puzzles requiring both characters
✔️ Physics-based platforming with precise controls
